# Clarett 8PreX — Data-Plane Capture Plan (PCM DMA streaming)

**Status:** PLAN — nothing captured yet. This scopes how to reverse-engineer the audio **data plane**
(bus-master DMA streaming): the methodology shift it needs, the tooling, and the phased capture
sequence. Tags: `[PLAN]` = intended approach; `[HYP]` = hypothesis to confirm; `[ANCHOR]` = a fact
already confirmed during control-plane RE that we build on.

The control plane (mixer/routing/gain/mute/clock/notifications) is reverse-engineered and documented
in `clarett-8prex-control-plane.md` + `clarett-8prex-fcp-transport.md`. This is the remaining work.

---

## 1. Why the existing method does not transfer

All control-plane RE relied on trapping BAR0 MMIO via QEMU `x-no-mmap` (`vfio_region_*` events). That
**only disables the BAR mmap; bus-master DMA to guest RAM is untouched and never appears in the
trace.** Audio samples move device↔RAM by DMA and never cross the BAR, so the MMIO trace can show the
streaming **setup and control** but *never a single sample*. `[ANCHOR: BAR0 = mailbox + DMA-control
only; samples move by DMA — hardware facts]`

This is the central shift: the data plane is RE'd by **triangulation across three channels**, not by
the BAR trace alone.

## 2. Three observation channels

| Channel | Tool | Sees | Blind to |
|---|---|---|---|
| BAR MMIO | `vfio_region_*` → `tools/bar_profile.py` | ring **addr/size/control** regs; pointer reads; ISR cause-reg reads | the sample DMA |
| Guest RAM | QEMU monitor `pmemsave`/`xp` at the ring base | **buffer layout**: sample format, interleave, channel order, stride, ring size | flow/timing (snapshot only) |
| MSI period IRQ | `fcp_decode.py --async` | **which vector** fires + cadence | the MSI delivery itself (irqfd) |

Registers say *where / how big*; RAM says *the format*; period IRQs say *the cadence and which vector*.

Unlike the control plane, there is **no public reference** — `scarlett2` is USB-isochronous, nothing
like this FPGA PCIe DMA engine. Expect this to be empirical and slower.

## 3. Anchors we already have `[ANCHOR]`

- **4 MSI vectors**, but bare metal fires **only vec0** for all control-plane events (mailbox-done +
  notifications); the cause regs `0x100`/`0x400` distinguish events, *not* the vector. **vec1/vec2/vec3
  are completely unused so far** — so they are the prime suspects for the playback/capture period IRQs.
  A streaming capture should reveal whether the data plane wakes them (watch their `/proc/interrupts`
  counts), or whether it too multiplexes onto vec0 with new cause registers.
- **DMA-address precedent:** GET responses DMA into a host buffer whose bus address is programmed at
  BAR `0x410` (low32) / `0x414` (high32). The audio **ring base(s) will be the same low32/high32
  pattern at *new* offsets** — exactly what `bar_profile.py` flags.
- **IRQ enable mask** `0x104 = 0xf000003f` — the low 6 bits (`0x3f`) may be per-stream period-IRQ
  enables that light up during streaming.
- **28 PCM playback / 28 PCM capture** channels; PCM pins `0x600`–`0x61b` both directions
  (control-plane §3). Loopback 1–2 at `0x60a`–`0x60b`.
- **Stream start may also use the mailbox.** The init-only opcodes `0x5000`/`0x6000`/`0x7000` are
  still unexplained and could be format/rate/stream setup — watch FCP traffic during stream start,
  not just new registers. Clock-source / sample-rate are dedicated FCP commands (control-plane §7),
  still untraced, and must be set before streaming.

## 4. Phased capture plan

**Phase 1 — Streaming setup (BAR registers). `[PLAN]`**
In the VM with Focusrite ASIO: driver load → start a playback stream → a few seconds → stop. Run
`bar_profile.py` and read off the registers active *only during streaming* (flagged `NEW`). Targets:
- **ring base address pair(s)** — low32/high32 writes (the `0x410`/`0x414` pattern); likely separate
  playback vs capture, possibly per-channel.
- **size / period registers**; a **start/stop control bit**; **pointer registers** (read repeatedly
  while streaming = the DMA position).
- correlate with the `0x104` enable mask and which cause regs become active.

**Phase 2 — Buffer layout (guest RAM). `[PLAN]`**
With the ring GPA(s) from Phase 1, snapshot guest RAM there during streaming (`pmemsave <gpa> <size>
<file>` from the QEMU monitor) while playing a **known signal**. Read off: sample width (16/24/32-bit),
interleave (per-channel blocks vs interleaved frames), channel ordering, frame stride, ring size.

**Phase 3 — Period IRQ correlation. `[PLAN]`**
Stream with `fcp_decode.py --async`; `vec1`/`vec2` (cause `0x200`/`0x300`) should fire at the period
rate. At a known rate+period the cadence is predictable (48000 / 256 ≈ 187 Hz), confirming the period
size and which vector is playback vs capture (run playback-only vs record-only to separate them).

**Phase 4 — Synthesize + implement. `[PLAN]`**
Combine into the streaming model, then build ALSA PCM: `snd_pcm_ops` (open/hw_params/prepare/trigger/
pointer), a DMA-coherent ring, register programming, and a period-IRQ handler calling
`snd_pcm_period_elapsed`.

## 5. Tooling

- **`tools/bar_profile.py`** (built): buckets every region0 access by offset and flags those outside
  the known control-plane map (§8 of the transport spec) — the "what lit up during streaming" diff.
  Classifies each offset's behaviour (write-once / addr-like / varying-read) to hint ring-base vs
  size vs pointer. `--new-only` shows just the data-plane candidates.
- **`fcp_decode.py --async`** (built): reused as-is for Phase 3 (period-IRQ vector + cadence).
- **Guest-RAM dump recipe** (to document once Phase 1 gives a ring base): QEMU monitor
  `pmemsave <gpa> <len> ring.bin`, then a tiny frame decoder to render it as N-channel frames.

## 6. Recommendations

- **Test signal:** play a **24-bit linear ramp** (or per-channel DC = channel index) instead of music
  — it makes sample width, stride, and channel order self-evident in the RAM dump.
- **Config:** 48 kHz, a mid buffer (256–512 frames) for a clean, predictable IRQ cadence.
- **Order:** **playback-only first**, then capture-only, then duplex — isolates the two ring/vector
  sets and keeps each capture simple.

## 7. Risks & unknowns

- **`x-no-mmap` may glitch streaming** (a trapped BAR is slow → underruns). Mitigation: we mainly need
  the *start-of-stream setup* and the *first few period IRQs*, not sustained clean audio — even a
  brief stream before underrun yields the register map.
- **Stream control may straddle mailbox + registers** — capture FCP and BAR together.
- **DMA is snapshot-only** from the host: no flow visibility, only RAM dumps at points in time.

## 8. Active bare-metal alternative `[PLAN]`

Our working control-plane driver already loads on real hardware. Once Phase 1 yields a candidate
register layout, an **active probe** is often faster than more passive tracing for a DMA engine:
program a guessed ring base/size, set the enable bit, and watch for (a) the buffer filling
(capture) or being consumed (playback) and (b) period IRQs on vec1/vec2 — reading the buffer back
**directly**, no `pmemsave` needed. Riskier (a bad address faults the IOMMU — we already saw an
AMD-Vi `IO_PAGE_FAULT` from one), so advance one register at a time.
